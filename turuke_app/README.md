#Turuke Frontend: The Poultry Management App 
Welcome to the Turuke Frontend, the Flutter-powered interface for small-scale poultry farmers to manage their flocks with ease! Built to sync with our backend API, this app is your one-stop shop for tracking eggs, managing flocks, logging vaccinations, and keeping diseases at bay. With offline sync and a snappy UI, it’s designed to work even when the Wi-Fi is as spotty as a hen’s feathers. Ready to hatch some productivity? Let’s dive in! 

##What’s Turuke All About?
Turuke is a poultry management app crafted for farmers who want to keep their coops in check without breaking a sweat. Whether you’re counting eggs, vaccinating your flock, or checking stats on your phone in the middle of a field, Turuke’s got your back. It’s built with love using Flutter, provider for state management, sqflite for offline magic, and fl_chart for those egg-citing yield graphs. Pair it with our Node.js backend, and you’ve got a farm management powerhouse!
